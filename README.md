## Overview

For this module I worked on creating different visualizations for NYC Citibike using a large database. These visualizations where made in order to evaluate if something similar would work in Des Moines, Iowa. This information would be presented to investors in order to start a similar buisniess in this citiy. The different graphs show a lot of usefull information which can be used to imagine how a business like this one would work in similar cities to NYC. At tha moment that I worked on this project, Tableu Public had an error and I was not able to upload my work. Fortunatly, I was able to take screenshots of the grpahs in order to draw intresting conclusions that will help us answer some key questions that will help us make a decision.

## Results

These where the visualizations that I consider where the most intresing and usefull from all the ones that I created:

### August Peak Hours:

<img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 09 07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200698306-c2ffa729-eb03-44e6-97b9-f5e9b6e49ced.png">

This visualization shows the hours in which the most bikes are used. With this graph we can clearly see that the best time to make repairs and give maintanance to the bikes is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. We can also see that people normaly use the bikes the most around 6 and 7 p.m. This might be because of the weather. It would also be interesting to see how the weather affects how much the users rent the bikes. 

### Top Starting Locations:

This visualizatio is very helpfull since it will help the investors have an idea of which locations are tipicaly the most populars to rent bikes. They could compare this results to Des Moines, Iowa in order to make important business decisions such as which areas should have more bikes. 

### Average Trip Duration:

This graph shows the average trip duration by user birthdate. As we can see on the graph, the younger the user is the more consistent and long their rides are. This visualization will help us identify our market target and get to know our costumers more. This will allow the investros to have more efective marketing campaigns. 
 
### Bike utilization: 

<img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 09 38" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200699396-449980ed-7e92-4308-acd1-25f18f7e87f3.png">

 This visualizatio helps us identifiy which bikes have been used the most in order to give them maintanance after a determined number of hours of use. This will allow the company and investros give a better service to their clientes and lower the probabilities of a bike breaking or having problems. 

### Bike Repairs:

<img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 09 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200699599-267e39b4-9cb7-4ee8-a896-7ba1a33f3e24.png">

This visualitacio will help the company identify which bikes have had the least maintanance and need to be taken care of more urgently than others. This graph together together with the bike utilization graph are very important in order to give a satisfactory service to the clients and make sure every bike works just fine. 

### Checkout Times for Users:
 
 <img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 09 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200699806-53675e7a-f6b9-4d30-9b57-36cff91e0e9d.png">

Unfortunatly I was not able to take a good screen shot of this visualization but the indofrmation that it displayed is very similar to the Checkout times by Gender. This information lets us know for how long the bikes are tipically used.
 
### Checkout Times by Gender:
 
 <img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 10 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200700165-54dbd03a-0e91-46a5-ae71-eba7eed6474b.png">

This visualization shows us that it is mostly males that have the longest checkout times. This information is helpful since decisions can be made in order to attack and retain this target audience or make changes in order to make their expirience better. 
 
### Trips by Weekday per Hour:
 
 <img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 10 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200700382-191a789c-2f58-4b47-9763-c6f275be1f1e.png">

This heatmap helps us identify which hours are the most busy of every weekday. As we can see and I mentioned earlier, the mos busy hours are tipically in the afternoon. We can also see that at 8 a.m. it is also a popular time to rent a bike between Monday and Friday. 
 
### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):

<img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 10 13" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200704684-4d2bbb6d-ea8d-4cd7-b9ad-0b34735d0a0b.png">

In this heatmap we can see that same information as the past heatmap but divided in gender which is helpful to understand how each type of cosutmer uses the bike service. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday:

<img width="1512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 22 10 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108498940/200705967-579bb5b3-b7db-4a98-8410-56cf058e952c.png">

This heatmap helps us identify the hours our diferent costumers use the bikes. The people that most use the bikes are males that are subscribed to the bike service and this way we can understand better their schedules and preferences. Maybe something can be done to reach a greater number of costumers.
