## Overview

For this module I worked on creating different visualizations for NYC Citibike using a large database. These visualizations where made in order to evaluate if something similar would work in Des Moines, Iowa. This information would be presented to investors in order to start a similar buisniess in this citiy. The different graphs show a lot of usefull information which can be used to imagine how a business like this one would work in similar cities to NYC. At tha moment that I worked on this project, Tableu Public had an error and I was not able to upload my work. Fortunatly, I was able to take screenshots of the grpahs in order to draw intresting conclusions that will help us answer some key questions that will help us make a decision.

## Results

These where the visualizations that I consider where the most intresing and usefull from all the ones that I created:

August Peak Hours:



This visualization shows the hours in which the most bikes are used. With this graph we can clearly see that the best time to make repairs and give maintanance to the bikes is between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. We can also see that people normaly use the bikes the most around 6 and 7 p.m. This might be because of the weather. It would also be interesting to see how the weather affects how much the users rent the bikes.
