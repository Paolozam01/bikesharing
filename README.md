## Overview

For this module I worked on creating different visualizations for NYC Citibike using a large database. These visualizations where made in order to evaluate if something similar would work in Des Moines, Iowa. This information would be presented to investors in order to start a similar buisniess in this citiy. The different graphs show a lot of usefull information which can be used to imagine how a business like this one would work in similar cities to NYC. At tha moment that I worked on this project, Tableu Public had an error and I was not able to upload my work. Fortunatly, I was able to take screenshots of the grpahs in order to draw intresting conclusions that will help us answer some key questions that will help us make a decision.
